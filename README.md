## Dashifen/Domain

An implementation of a domain for use in an action-domain-responder (ADR) application.  Loosely based on the Aura frameworks similar implementations, this one removes the need for separate gateway and filter classes rolling that behavior into the domain and entity objects respectively.  This helps cut down on the number of files within the framework while walking right up to the line separating the single responsibility principle from the abyss.
